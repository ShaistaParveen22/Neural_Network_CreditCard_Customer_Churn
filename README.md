# Neural_Network_CreditCard_Customer_Churn
CreditCard_Customer_Churn_ Project

I'm thrilled to share the results of my recent project where I built and trained a Neural Network for Credit Card Churn Prediction. 📊💳

🔍 Project Overview:
📈 I used a Credit Card Churn dataset to predict customer churn, a critical challenge in the financial industry.
🧠 Developed a Neural Network model to analyze customer behavior and make accurate predictions.
🎯 Achieved an impressive accuracy of 86.7% on the test dataset, demonstrating the power of machine learning in solving real-world problems.

💡 Key Takeaways:
🌐 This project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making, especially in industries like finance.
💪 The Neural Network's performance underscores the potential of AI to improve customer retention and business profitability.
🤖 The future of finance is in AI, and I'm excited to be a part of it!


I'm open to discussions and excited about the opportunities in the AI and Machine Learning field. Let's connect and explore more possibilities together!
